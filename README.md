# PyRadarWebapp
This is a basic radar webapp built on the Flask framework.

It fetches fetches recent images from a given radar station and animates them into a .gif.
It then renders this as a webpage.

This was written to provide a fast, minimal radar interface.
It's very easy to add links to the main page that will go to given radar stations.

The radar station is specified with a query in the url.
